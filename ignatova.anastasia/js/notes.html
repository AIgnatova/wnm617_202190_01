Difference between forEach, map and reduce

forEach - loop through each item in array and do something to each item

map - loop through each item, do something to/change each element and return an array to a variable

forEach - does not return to a variable

reduce - loop though an array to get to one new item, even if it's an array'


race condition - you have two things happening, 
you expect the first thing to happen first, 
but for some reason the second thing happens first 
and it's bad.'
